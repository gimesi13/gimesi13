- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Gergely Gimesi and I'm 26 years old. 
I have a BA degree in Business Economics and I currently work as a Sales Manager.
Iâ€™m learning React.js as a hobby, and I recently started freelancing, building websites for small businesses.
I really enjoy web development, and I picture myself in the future working as a professional software developer.
